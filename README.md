# 3x3_Squared_Magic_Square_Finder
Inspired by this video: bit.ly/ParkerSquare, this python script attempts to find a 3x3 magic square using only unique squared numbers. Each attempt is categorized into how many of the rows match. In order to save on space and loading times, results with no matches are not stored. It is by no means perfect, but it is functional.
